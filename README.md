# Bacteriophage-bacteria interaction simulation

This repository contains the Python Langevin dynamics simulations of the interaction between point particles, some of them representing bacteriophages, while the others represent self-propelled bacteria, both subject to brownian motion and interacting between one another via a WCA force. Work by J.C. Perez-Ramirez under the supervision of Dr. F. Alarcon-Oseguera.
